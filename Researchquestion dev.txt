Research objective: How do differences in local abiotic and biotic influence the foodweb origination and build up and biomass development in rewetted floodplains

RQ1: What are the current available knowns and unkowns of ecological effects of rewetting of floodplains

RQ2: what are the imporant variables and mechanisms of fast development of a new foodweb and biomass in rewetted floodplains. 

RQ3: Can numerical models or geographical information systems, accurately predict and analyze the effects of floodplain rewetting and increase understanding of the floodplain ecosystems.
